A WordPress plugin that allows you to specify custom URL redirects for directing users after they login or register.

== Description ==

With this WordPress plugin, you can redirect your users to any URL after they login or register with your WooCommerce-enabled website.

By default, WooCommerce redirects users to not so helpful pages after they login or register. In the case of users who login, they are sent to the "My Account" endpoint which immediately asks them if they want to logout. Your users literally just logged in, I can't imagine they did so just to logout right away. Not the best user experience. 

And yes, you can customize the "My Account" page, but ultimately, if you're a store owner, you're likely keen to engage your users and continue to monetize them; and you can't do that effectively with the default flow.

That's where this plugin comes in. With Login & Register Redirect for WooCommerce, you can specify one URL to redirect users after login, and you can specify another URL to redirect users after registration. You can send your users anywhere you want. 

And, that's it! It's that easy.

== Installation ==

If you want to install the plugin manually

1. Upload the contents of `lrr-for-woocommerce.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once it's active, you can set your redirect URLs by following these steps:

1. Go to Settings => Login & Register Redirect for WooCommerce
2. You will see 2 fields; one for Login and one for Register
3. To implement a custom redirect, put any URL in those fields and click Save.
4. To return to the default settings, just clear those fields and click Save.
